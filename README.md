Twice a year, Viget employees carpool to and from large company events. Currently, the office manager handles the organization of these carpools herself, using a time consuming and fragile combination of Google Docs and email correspondence. Motorpool is a web app with the intended goal of minimizing the pain of coordinating carpools, both for office managers and employees.
